To prove or disprove this statement, we can consider the worst-case scenario where the sequence of n different numbers is already sorted in either ascending or descending order. In this case, inserting each number into the tree would result in a linear chain of nodes (skewed tree), which would not adhere to the rules of an easy binary search tree.

Therefore, the statement is disproved as not all sequences of n different numbers can be inserted into an easy binary search tree in O(n) time.
