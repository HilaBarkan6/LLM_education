One possible implementation of a data structure that supports these operations in amortized time O(log n) is a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST) such as an AVL tree, Red-Black tree, or Splay tree.

Here is a brief overview of how each operation would work in a Balanced Binary Search Tree:

1. Insert(x): To insert a new element x into a BBST, we would perform a standard binary search to find the correct position for x in the tree, then rebalance the tree if necessary to maintain the balance property of the tree. The rebalancing step typically involves performing rotations or other operations to ensure that the tree remains balanced. This rebalancing step takes O(log n) time in the worst case, which gives us an amortized time complexity of O(log n) for the insert operation.

2. Search(x): To search for an element x in a BBST, we would perform a standard binary search starting from the root of the tree and recursively traversing down the tree based on the comparison of x with the current node. Since each level of the tree eliminates half of the remaining nodes, the search operation takes O(log n) time in the worst case, giving us an amortized time complexity of O(log n).

3. Delete(x): To delete an element x from a BBST, we would first search for the node containing x in the tree, then rearrange the tree to maintain the balance property after removing the node with x. The rearranging step typically involves performing rotations or other operations to ensure that the tree remains balanced. This rearranging step takes O(log n) time in the worst case, which gives us an amortized time complexity of O(log n) for the delete operation.

Overall, using a Balanced Binary Search Tree allows us to perform insert, search, and delete operations in amortized time O(log n), making it an efficient data structure for these operations.
